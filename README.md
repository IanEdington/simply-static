## Support

This is the developer site for Simply Static. For support, please visit [the WordPress support forums for Simply Static](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simply-static).

## Reporting bugs

If you find an issue, [let us know](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simply-static)! We want to make the best static site generator plugin possible, and every bug we crush gets us one step closer.

Here are some things that would help us in your bug report:

1. Step-by-step description of every step you took (screenshots and/or screen recordings are great too)
2. What you expected to happen
3. What actually happened
4. Any error messages you encountered  
    If you're not seeing any error messages but you're having an issue, it could be that they're being squelched by WordPress. You can find code in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jrfnl/5925642) that will help you enable error messages and display backtraces.
5. WordPress version and other plugins being used
6. Webserver details, including:  
    - Operating system of the server
    - Webserver in use (e.g. Apache, nginx, IIS, etc.)
    - PHP version
    - MySQL version
7. Do you have an educated guess as to what caused the problem?
8. Can you suggest a solution?
